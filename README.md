# DormDesigner

# Commit Protocol

Each subteam (Frontend, Backend, 3D) has their own branch and consists of 2 members. Each person maintains their own personal branch when developing and pushes only to their subteam's branch. All merge conflicts must be resolved at this level before proceeding. 

To merge a subteam's branch into main, it requires approval from at least 1 representative from each of the other two teams.

# Setup

Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/escapeprograms/DormDesigner.git`

Inside the `DormDesigner` folder, run `npm run "dev set up"`.

# Running
One-step build and run: `npm run .` in `DormDesigner`

In development, you can build and run parts separately:

Build frontend: `npm run build` in `dorm-designer`

Run frontend: `npm start` in `dorm-designer`

Run backend: `node .` in `DormDesigner`
